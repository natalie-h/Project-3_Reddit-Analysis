    "For this article, your problem statement will be: _What characteristics of a post on Reddit contribute most to the overall interaction (as measured by number of comments)?_\n",
    "\n",
    "Your method for acquiring the data will be scraping the 'hot' threads as listed on the [Reddit homepage](https://www.reddit.com/). You'll acquire _AT LEAST FOUR_ pieces of information about each thread:\n",
    "1. The title of the thread\n",
    "2. The subreddit that the thread corresponds to\n",
    "3. The length of time it has been up on Reddit\n",
    "4. The number of comments on the thread\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've got the data, you will build a classification model that, using Natural Language Processing and any other relevant features, predicts whether or not a given Reddit post will have above or below the _median_ number of comments.\n",

    "**BONUS PROBLEMS**\n",
    "1. If creating a logistic regression, GridSearch Ridge and Lasso for this model and report the best hyperparameter values.\n",
    "1. Scrape the actual text of the threads using Selenium (you'll learn about this in Webscraping II).\n",

    "Based on the above results, we can make the following interpretations:\n",
    "\n",
    "One: subreddit popularity is a moderately strong indicator of the success of a \"hot\" thread on Reddit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF to determine the most popular words across post titles, after removing stop words, won't provide an immense insight for our Classification models. This could be for several reasons, however, and there is room here to clean our data further to search for improvement. For example: if we could remove foreign languages, we could potentially allay some of the noise introduced into the model at fitting. However, even with features as relatively universal as emojis, the model couldn't be improved significantly with any particular group of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our relatively small data above the 75% mark of comments on a thread, bagging classifiers can only assist so much without overfitting on our training set, as evidenced above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in trying to run a sentiment analysis of the titles of the posts, the limitations of the analysis are very clear. Redditors are known for their wit and sarcasm, and SIA is only able to pick up on so much creative language. In a cursory glance at titles that are marked as 'strongly' positive or negative, it is easy to see where the analyzer has limitations. Furthermore, there are many expressions and acronyms that the analyzer likely isn't ready to begin analyzing adequately, thus affecting the true compound score of a post. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another side effect of using SIA is seen in the overwhelming volume of posts that are categorized as simply 'neutral', leaving us with very little data as either strongly negative or positive otherwise. And while a strong compound score can be a good indicator of the popularity of a post in terms of the number of comments, it should be noted that the model strangely predicts roughly 50% R-squared when guessing if the number of posts will be at least above the median number of posts for all posts scraped, roughly 75% when classifying the top quarter of posts, and roughly 10-12% when classifying Tukey's outliers which is also roughly how many of these posts fall into this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, when attempting to use a Regressor in place of a Classifier model, the model fairs almost as well as random chance in predicting the number of comments a post will generate, suggesting that many of the above reasons may have an impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, there is still a long way to go before predicting if positive or negative titles, or certain buzzwords featured in various titles, will be able to predict the success of a Reddit post."
